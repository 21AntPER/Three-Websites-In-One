# Three-Websites-In-One
This originally began with me trying to create a working website similar to youtube, but then I decided to compile a newly written todoList website and calculator with it(calling it macrosoft for comedic reasons). All client-side javascript was written in ejs referenced as a partial. I later on found out javascript files can be linked, as long as the files are in the public folder. This is my first long term project.
